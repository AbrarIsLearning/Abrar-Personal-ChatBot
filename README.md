# Abrar-Personal-ChatBot
While CISC108 at the University of Delaware was the introductory class for Python. I wanted to take it a step further and make something more personal with what I had learnt. Not some school project or 
assignment no, I wanted something I could use in my day to day life. And what better project idea was to make a Chat Bot for the Discord IM and VOIP Social Network. At first it started as a basic "User Inputs 
Commands -> Bot Responds to Command," it has slowly become the playground for me to learn new concepts and ideas. What better way to learn something then to try intergrate and understand it in a project I use 
almost every single day.
