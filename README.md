# Abrar-Personal-ChatBot
While CISC108 at the University of Delaware was the introductory class for Python. I wanted to take it a step further and make something more personal with what I had learnt. Not some school project or 
assignment no, I wanted something I could use in my day to day life. And what better project idea was to make a Chat Bot for the Discord IM and VOIP Social Network. At first it started as a basic "User Inputs 
Commands -> Bot Responds to Command," it has slowly become the playground for me to learn new concepts and ideas. What better way to learn something then to try intergrate and understand it in a project I use 
almost every single day. This goes beyond learning Python and delves into other libraries. PyTube, a Python Library used to download Youtube videos became my first major intergration into this bot. Due to the 
social nature of Discord (It is a VOIP and IM after all) it is very common for my friends and I to send each other music, memes, videos and other video formats in the form of Youtube links to one another. I 
personally really like storing data offline as I will always have access to it, so what better way then to take those videos my friends and I send each other, and download them right from Discord!
